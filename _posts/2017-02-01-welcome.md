I am a PhD student in the National University of Central Buenos Aires, currently working on Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Marine Robotics. My PhD is currently suported by a scolarship from the National Research Council (CONICET). You can see a list of my publications below, and also you can check my [github](https://github.com/IgnacioCarlucho) where I host various algorithms I am currently working on.
